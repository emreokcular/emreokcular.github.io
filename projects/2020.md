Did you ever wonder about the optimism trend about the toughest year 2021 during 2020 ? We all faced with up and down mental mood during 2020. I wonder how to analyze this mood of the people from all over the world.

To answer this question, all the tweets and replies of the twitter bot account [Progress Bar 2021](https://twitter.com/ProgressBar202_) is collected with Twitter API. [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) package is used for all the API calls with secret key and tokens.

Progress Bar 2021 divides the year into 100 pieces and tweets 1% progress in every 4 days.

100 tweets that show the progress of 2020 and its replies are analysed.

In the below graph, favorites and retweet counts are visualized for each tweet which represents 1% progress.

It is interesting that July 2020 has one of the highest favorite count.

Then compound sentiment scores are calculated for each reply by using [VaderSentiment](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).

In the below graph, you can see the average sentiment score of all the replies per 1% progress.

From January to July replies containing 2021 keyword have positive sentiment scores mostly. Between July and November negative replies about 2021 increased significantly. After November it is clear that good wishes about 2021 is increased.

Scientists and inventors study the characteristics of things in nature and come up with amazing technologies and products invented as a result of exploring natureâ€”for example, flights, submarines, bullet trains, flippers, and cat eyes. Moreover, we can also list Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms as an example of bio-inspired algorithms. In this post, we will take a closer look at the evolution of neural networks from a philosophical perspective. We will be fascinated by the development of this biomimicry approach as a simple mathematical model into a most complex artificial neural network identified as a black-box algorithm.

As human beings, we learn from data continuously. We have been collecting, storing and processing data since the moment we were born. These amazing processes happen in a marvelous supercomputer, which is the most complex machine on earth: the human brain. Beyond that, even it is so exciting in itself, I am enthralled by a blend of science, technology and mathematics. Deep Learning stands right there. We are in a new era so that we do not program computers how to do, we teach them how to learn.

In 1958, american psychologist and computer scientist [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) published the paper [THE PERCEPTRON: A PROBABILISTIC MODEL FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION IN THE BRAIN](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.3398&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in Cornell Psychological Review. This is considered as the first mathematical model and core structure of modern deep learning models which is basically a mathematical model inspired by brain neurons.

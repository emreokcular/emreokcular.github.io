>  "Iâ€™m still learning." - Michelangelo, at age 83


As Michelangelo said, learning is a fascinating process in a lifelong journey. As human beings, we learn from data continuously. We have been collecting, storing and processing data since the moment we were born. These amazing processes happen in a marvelous supercomputer, which is the most complex machine on earth: the human brain. Beyond that, even it is so exciting in itself, I am enthralled by a blend of science, technology and mathematics. Data Science stands right there. We are in a new era so that we do not program computers how to do, we teach them how to learn. I would like to be a part of this revolution. Therefore, I passionately want to be a hands- on, highly competent and successful data scientist in order to find hidden answers and to make data- driven decisions in the ever-growing data universe by creating algorithms, building learning models, analyzing, exploring and discovering insights. In my opinion, the solutions with data are limitless; hence I commit myself to the innovative application of it. As strong pathfinders, my experiences, intellectual curiosity, background, interests and ambition drew me to data science on my lifelong learning path.
